			<b>Problem description</b> <p>
The current work process of the Content Review Team requires each team member to be able to work fast and efficiently in Google Sheets. Each team member has strong technical skills but different levels of proficiency in Google Sheets. The training is designed to overcome existing gaps in Google Sheets proficiency and help the team to be able to work more efficiently. The current level of proficiency does not allow team members to perform all required steps in Google Sheets. That slows down the process and requires team leads to intervene and help with the Google Sheets layout on a recurring basis.<p><div class="foto2"> <img src="img/screenshot.png" alt="Svetlana Titova" class="center" /> </div> Interactive, multimedia eLearning products are the best approach to solve it because the team is working on a different schedule and each team member has downtime on different timeslots. The interactive project will allow each team member to access the training at the best suitable time and will not require interrupting the workflow. </h4>
